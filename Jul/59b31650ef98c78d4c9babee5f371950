PayWithCapture is a mobile payment solution that permits customers to make payments by scanning a merchant’s pre-generated QR-Code using the camera of their mobile device or via a one-step Beacon-NFC System. It can be linked with different payment cards (any bank’s MasterCard/VISA, bank account, mobile wallet) and affords customers the opportunity of selecting which payment instrument he/she chooses to use. Access Bank explained that with PayWithCapture, a user can add as many cards or payment instruments (bank accounts and mobile money wallets) as desired. It stressed that this journey of inclusiveness is based on the belief that inclusiveness is the first step in the journey of innovation and the biggest players in the mobile space have been those who opened up their platforms to other players. The bank said the solution is a unique mobile payment solution with in-built loyalty points and coupon rewards, adding that merchants can also use the PayWithCapture Coupon System to reward their customers without the need to invest in complex reward systems. PayWithCapture Beacon-NFC Pay allows Merchants to push Ads and content to consumers, which helps to look beyond traditional value chains for new opportunities. Commenting on this innovation by Access Bank, Group Managing Director, Herbert Wigwe said, “Forging growth in mobile payment solutions requires inclusiveness. For the potential of mobile payment technologies to truly explode, it is important that we begin to see it as more than a bank initiative but more of a consumer initiative and that is where inclusiveness comes in. We are committed to providing solutions that meet people in their niche and we have been working closely. To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .

He said such rise came from private business owners, diplomats and corporate establishments and for which the airline had to step in to fill with a direct flight emanating from Abijan to Lagos. “This country (Nigeria) offers a huge business market with a growing movement of individual businesses and telecoms, banks, manufacturers, oil and gas multinationals from Nigeria to Cote d’Ivoire,” said Fofana. Indeed, the Nigerian aviation market has been described by many analysts to be growing in leaps and bounds in recent years and Fofana said since the commencement of operations early 2015 patronage has kept going higher.

Mr. Femi Omotayo, Managing Director AOS Orwell made this observation last Wednesday at the facility launch of the Multi-million naira Value Asset Management Center (VAMC) and the integrated control and safety system in Port Harcourt, Rivers State capital. The event, which has Mr. Denzil Kentebe, the Executive Secretary, Nigerian Content Development And Monitoring Board (NCDMB) in attendance also attracted the representative of Shell Petroleum Development Company (SPDC), foreign partners and other leading indigenous companies. Flagging off the event, Omotayo said before the merger between AOS and Orwell, there was hardly anyone to trust their capability to deliver, including some banks.
He noted that with the successful merger many years ago, which brought about the name AOS Orwell, the company did not only became stronger, trusted and reliable, it became the leading service providing company in Nigeria and Africa. The MD who named some of the services rendered by the company as Float & Cementing Aids, Fishing & Remedial Services, Casing &Tubing Running, Wireline & Pipe Recovery, Drilling Tools Rentals, and Machining & Fabrication etc. said the company has won the heart of Africa. He said there is no success story without challenges, adding that in 34 years of the company’s existence, it has been a long way, but at the end they have shown commitment to Nigerians and stood were others couldn’t.
“As indigenous service providers I think we’ve come a very long way. I want to take you back to those days when we were not even able to participate in this industry; today we have indigenous oil companies that are making us proud. AOS Orwell is just like an elephant today due to the merger.”
“We started by selling safety boots, consumables, today we are the leading fishing services company in Nigeria. We are also leading in the machine shop business in Nigeria; we are one of the leading pipelines covering business in Nigeria.
But when we realised it was changing, we had to do something different to sustain the business.” To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .

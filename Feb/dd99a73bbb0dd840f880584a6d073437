Zenith Bank also moved to number 388 from 453 in 2014 while Guaranty Trust Bank rose to 417 from 422 on the world table. Access Bank made first entry into the ranking. Brand value of First Bank increased to $300 million in 2015 from $228 in 2014 and according to the Economics Editor of the magazine, Silvia Pavoni, the brand value is “the licensing rate that a third-party would need to pay to use that company’s brand.” Commenting on the methodology of the ranking, Pavoni said Brand Finance obtained brand-specific financial and revenue data;  modeled the market to identify market demand and the position of individual banks in the context of all other market competitors; established the royalty rate for each bank; calculated the discount rate specific to each bank, taking account of its size, geographical presence, reputation, gearing and brand rating and discounted future royalty stream (explicit forecast and perpetuity periods) to a net present value  which is the brand value. This approach, the Economics Editor noted, is used as it is favoured by tax authorities and the courts because it calculates brand values by reference to documented third-party transactions and it can be done based on publicly available financial information.” Globally, Wells Fargo of the United States of America retains the number one banking brand in the world for the third consecutive year and was followed by banks in China, United Kingdom and Spain in the first ten. Wells Fargo’s brand value for 2015 is $34.9 billion as against $30.2 billion in 2014, an increase of $4.7 billion. The first 10 banks in the world are Well Fargo (USA); ICBC (China); HSBC (UK); China Construction Bank; Citibank, Bank of America, Chase (USA); Agricultural Bank of China; Bank of China; and Santander (Spain). On the rise of Chinese banks, the chief operating officer of Brand Finance, Bryn Anderson noted that “the Chinese economy has been doing well for a number of years but I think this has been the first year, in terms of brand value, when Chinese banks have climbed up the tables and stood out.” The Banker’s Top 500 Banking Brands ranking measures the value of financial services firms across the world, analysing specific sectors and geographies, and identifying the brands that have improved the most, as well as those that have suffered the greatest setbacks.

A new report by Apex Insight, called European Parcel Shop and Locker Networks Market Insight Report 2015, revealed that parcel shops and locker networks are ‘rapidly becoming an essential component of the logistics operations involved in getting internet purchases into the hands of consumers while also remaining a key element of spare parts logistics operations.’ Konga.com had in May this year signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with NIPOST for the delivery of purchased items within University of Lagos community. Speaking to Nigeria CommunicationsWeek on the revolutionary parcel shop opened by NIPOST on the Campus, Dr. Asuquo Abianga, area postal manager, Lagos Mainland Territory (LMT), Nigeria Postal Service (NIPOST), said the Service parcel shops are credible platforms for e-commerce operators to leverage. Part of preparations to boost the operations, LMT recently received four vehicles and twenty motorcycles too delivered from the headquarters. “At the moment, Konga.com has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with NIPOST and as at May 2015, we delivered over 700 items to their clients within the shortest time after the launch. Konga sends the items to us and we deliver within the University environment. The gesture shall be replicated in all the tertiary institutions in the country in segment and will lead to even more people buying items through the e-commerce channels,” he said.
